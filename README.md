# Comprehensive MATLAB Image Processing Project

## Project Overview
This project encapsulates a series of MATLAB scripts demonstrating a wide range of image processing techniques. It covers foundational concepts in image manipulation and enhancement, showcasing my skills in digital image processing using MATLAB.

## Key Concepts and Techniques

### Image Resizing and Transformation
- Custom image resizing (`custom_resize_function.m`).
- Color space transformation: RGB to grayscale (`gray_level.m`).
- Image scaling: both upscaling and downscaling (`up_down_scale.m`).

### Image Enhancement Techniques
- Power-law (gamma) transformations (`power_law.m`).
- Logarithmic transformations for brightness enhancement (`log_transform.m`).
- Histogram equalization for contrast adjustment (`histogram.m`).

## Tools and Technologies
- **MATLAB**: Core platform for implementing image processing algorithms.
- **Image Processing Toolbox (MATLAB)**: Extensively used for advanced image manipulation tasks.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Proficiency in MATLAB and image processing concepts.
- Ability to apply complex transformations and enhancements to images.
- Competence in various image enhancement techniques.
